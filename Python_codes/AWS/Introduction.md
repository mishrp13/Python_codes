My name is Prabal Mishra, and I am a DevOps Engineer with experience in building scalable and automated infrastructure on AWS Cloud, with strong expertise in Kubernetes,Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.

In my current role at Tata Consultancy Services, I have implemented containerization and Kubernetes-based orchestration that significantly reduced environment-related issues, designed CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins to accelerate deployments, and ensured high availability for production environments. 

I hold a B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Chandigarh University, and I am passionate about automating infrastructure, improving release velocity, and ensuring reliable cloud-native systems.

I’m excited about this opportunity because I want to bring my expertise in DevOps practices, cloud automation, and production reliability to contribute to your team’s success.”
